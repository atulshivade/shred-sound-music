# Encore — Music Performance & Challenge Portal

A dark-themed music platform where **teachers** post challenges, **students**
upload performance videos tagged by instrument and skill, and the community
discovers what's next via a feed with a Best Performer spotlight.

> Built by **Digital COE Gen AI Team**.

---

## Highlights

- **Music-first uploads.** Each performance is tagged by **Instrument**
  (Acoustic Guitar, Electric Guitar, Bass, Keyboard, Piano, Synth, Drums,
  Vocals, Violin, Flute, Sax, Other) and **Skill Level** (Beginner →
  Intermediate → Advanced → Pro).
- **Pluggable video hosting.** `IVideoProvider` ships three implementations:
  `LOCAL` (filesystem, dev-friendly), `BUNNY` (Bunny.net Stream — HLS, cost
  effective, DRM-friendly), and `VIMEO` (private/unlisted). Choose with one
  env var.
- **TikTok / Vimeo / YouTube embeds** without an upload — paste a link and
  the embed type is auto-detected.
- **Teacher evaluation studio** with a real video player, **timestamped
  feedback** ("watch the wrist at 0:42" — captured from the playhead),
  **multi-axis scoring** (Rhythm / Technique / Musicality, 0–10 each),
  **Verified** badge, and **Best Performer** crown with audit trail.
- **Best Performer spotlight** on the feed, plus per-challenge highlight on
  the detail page.
- **Filterable feed and gallery** by instrument and skill.
- **Dark, music-platform UI** out of the box. Glowing violet primary,
  electric magenta accent, near-black surface.

## Quick start

### Option A — Zero-install (PGlite, no Docker required)

```powershell
npm install
$env:AUTH_SECRET = "any-32-char-string-for-dev-only"
npm run db:seed   # creates demo users + music challenges + sample performances
npm run dev
```

That's it. The app boots an embedded Postgres (`PGlite`) into `.data/pgdata/`,
applies all migrations, serves at http://localhost:3000.

### Option B — Supabase / Neon / external Postgres

```powershell
cp .env.example .env.local
# Set DATABASE_URL to your Supabase connection string and AUTH_SECRET to a strong secret.
# Optionally set VIDEO_PROVIDER=bunny + BUNNY_STREAM_* for production-grade hosting.
npm install
npm run db:push       # syncs the Drizzle schema
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

### Demo accounts (password = `Password123`)

| Role | Email |
|---|---|
| Teacher (admin) | `admin@portal.dev` |
| Student (acoustic guitar, intermediate) | `alex@portal.dev` |
| Student (piano, advanced) | `riya@portal.dev` |

Open http://localhost:3000.

## Database schema (high level)

```
user            (id, email, name, role[ADMIN|STUDENT],
                 primary_instrument, skill_level, points, …)
account / session / verificationToken                 # Auth.js tables

challenge       (id, title, description, deadline, status, points,
                 instrument_focus, skill_level_target, …)

performance     (id, challenge_id, student_id,
                 instrument, skill_level,
                 video_provider[LOCAL|BUNNY|VIMEO|EMBED],
                 video_url, video_external_id, video_duration_seconds,
                 thumbnail_url, status[PENDING|PUBLISHED|REJECTED],
                 is_verified, is_best_performer, likes_count, …)

feedback        (id, performance_id, teacher_id, note,
                 timestamp_sec,            -- pin to a moment in the video
                 rhythm_score, technique_score, musicality_score,
                 is_private, …)

top_performer   (id, performance_id, challenge_id, selected_by_id,
                 reason, period[CHALLENGE|WEEK|MONTH|ALLTIME], selected_at)

performance_like (performance_id, user_id, created_at)
```

Inferred TypeScript types are exported from `src/db/schema.ts` — use them
everywhere instead of redefining shapes.

## Routes

### Public
- `/` — landing
- `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`

### Authenticated (any role)
- `/challenges` — active challenges grid (with instrument-focus badges)
- `/challenges/[id]` — detail + your performance uploader + filterable
  gallery + Best Performer highlight
- `/feed` — filterable feed by instrument / skill, with Best Performer
  spotlight at the top

### Teacher (admin) only
- `/admin` — studio dashboard
- `/admin/challenges/new` — create challenge with instrument focus + skill target
- `/admin/evaluate` — evaluation studio with per-card actions

### API
- `POST /api/upload` — auth required, image/video, 25 MB cap, raw storage
- `POST /api/upload/video` — auth required, video only, 200 MB cap, routes
  through `IVideoProvider`. Returns
  `{ provider, externalId, playbackUrl, thumbnailUrl, durationSeconds, contentType, size }`.

Route protection is enforced **twice** — `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 edge
proxy) for redirects, plus `requireAdmin()` / server-component checks for
defence in depth.

---

## Video provider — how to swap

`src/lib/video.ts` ships with three implementations selected by `VIDEO_PROVIDER`:

```env
# .env.local
VIDEO_PROVIDER=bunny
BUNNY_STREAM_LIBRARY_ID=12345
BUNNY_STREAM_API_KEY=...
BUNNY_STREAM_CDN_HOSTNAME=vz-abcdef-123.b-cdn.net
```

```env
VIDEO_PROVIDER=vimeo
VIMEO_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
```

```env
VIDEO_PROVIDER=local        # default — writes to public/uploads/videos/
```

Add a new provider by implementing `IVideoProvider` and adding a `case` in
the factory. **No call-site changes** are required: every `<VideoPlayer>` and
gallery card already understands the four `VideoProvider` enum values.

---

## Storage

`src/lib/storage.ts` exposes `IStorageProvider`. The default
`LocalStorageProvider` writes to `public/uploads/<scope>/<uuid>.<ext>`. Swap
to S3/R2/Supabase Storage by implementing the interface and selecting via
`STORAGE_PROVIDER`.

The local video provider delegates to this storage provider, so configuring
S3 also moves your dev video uploads to S3.

---

## Sanity scripts

Two PowerShell scripts in `scripts/` run end-to-end against the dev server:

```powershell
# Read sweep — every route returns the expected status for each role
powershell -File scripts\sanity.ps1 -Email admin@portal.dev -Password Password123 -Role ADMIN
powershell -File scripts\sanity.ps1 -Email alex@portal.dev  -Password Password123 -Role STUDENT

# Write sweep — image + video upload, role-gated UI, music-domain rendering
powershell -File scripts\sanity-write.ps1
```

---

## What's done vs. what's next

### Done
- Music-first schema (instruments, skill levels, video metadata, multi-axis
  feedback, top_performers audit table)
- `IVideoProvider` with Local / Bunny.net / Vimeo
- `/api/upload/video` with auth, MIME, and size guards
- Performance uploader (file or embed) tagging instrument + skill
- Filterable feed + per-challenge gallery
- Best Performer spotlight on feed and challenge detail
- Teacher evaluation studio with timestamped feedback (captures playhead)
  and 0–10 scoring on rhythm / technique / musicality
- Verified badge + Best Performer crown with audit trail in `top_performer`
- Dark music-platform theme (default)

### Next
- TikTok-style vertical-scroll feed mode (current is a grid spotlight)
- Likes endpoint + leaderboard view (table + `points` column already exist)
- Email + Google OAuth wiring (env vars are already there)
- Supabase Auth swap (currently Auth.js using Postgres for storage)
- HLS playback through `hls.js` for non-Safari browsers

---

## Known notes

- **PGlite is single-process.** If you mutate the DB from a `tsx` script
  while the dev server is running, the server holds stale in-memory state
  until restart. Use `npm run db:seed` only when the dev server is stopped,
  or prefer Supabase/Neon for parallel-process workflows.
- **`Unhandled Rejection: TypeError: ... Received an instance of URL`**
  during `POST /api/auth/callback/credentials` is upstream noise from
  `next-auth@beta` running under Turbopack. The credentials callback still
  returns 302 and sets the session cookie. Functional sanity is green.
