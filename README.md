# Shred Sound Music — Performance & Challenge Portal

A responsive music platform where **teachers** post challenges, **students**
upload performance videos tagged by instrument and skill, and the Shred Sound
Music community discovers what's next via a feed with a Best Performer
spotlight. Mobile-first banded layout that scales cleanly to laptop and tablet.

> Built by [logicboxlab.com](https://logicboxlab.com).

## Live demo

- **Production:** https://shred-sound-music.logicboxlab.com
- **Local URL:** http://localhost:3000 (run `npm run dev`)
- **Teacher login:** `admin@portal.dev` / `Password123`
- **Student logins:** `alex@portal.dev` / `Password123`, `riya@portal.dev` / `Password123`

> The seed includes 3 challenges, 2 sample performances and one **Best
> Performer** (Riya's Chopin take). When deploying to a serverless host
> (Vercel, AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers, …) point `VIDEO_PROVIDER` at
> a remote provider (Cloudinary / Bunny / Vimeo) so the FILE upload tab
> stays enabled — the [Deploying](#deploying) section below walks
> through the env vars step-by-step.

## Highlights

- **Music-first uploads.** Each performance is tagged by **Instrument**
  (Acoustic Guitar, Electric Guitar, Bass, Keyboard, Piano, Synth, Drums,
  Vocals, Violin, Flute, Sax, Other) and **Skill Level** (Beginner →
  Intermediate → Advanced → Pro).
- **Pluggable video hosting.** `IVideoProvider` ships three implementations:
  `LOCAL` (filesystem, dev-friendly), `BUNNY` (Bunny.net Stream — HLS, cost
  effective, DRM-friendly), and `VIMEO` (private/unlisted). Choose with one
  env var.
- **TikTok / Vimeo / YouTube embeds** without an upload — paste a link and
  the embed type is auto-detected.
- **Teacher evaluation studio** with a real video player, **timestamped
  feedback** ("watch the wrist at 0:42" — captured from the playhead),
  **multi-axis scoring** (Rhythm / Technique / Musicality, 0–10 each),
  **Verified** badge, and **Best Performer** crown with audit trail.
- **Best Performer spotlight** on the feed, plus per-challenge highlight on
  the detail page.
- **Filterable feed and gallery** by instrument and skill.
- **Responsive banded UI** out of the box. Light cream / white / charcoal
  palette with a warm gold accent. Mobile-first single column at ≤ 768 px,
  comfortable centred reading column at tablet width, and a 2-column hero
  + submit split at ≥ 1024 px so laptops don't waste their viewport.
- **Mobile app, future scope.** The current target is a polished mobile-web
  experience; a wrapped or React Native client can sit on top of the same
  Next.js API routes (`/api/upload/video`, `/api/upload/capabilities`,
  `/api/auth/*`).

## Quick start

### Option A — Zero-install (PGlite, no Docker required)

```powershell
npm install
$env:AUTH_SECRET = "any-32-char-string-for-dev-only"
npm run db:seed   # creates demo users + music challenges + sample performances
npm run dev
```

That's it. The app boots an embedded Postgres (`PGlite`) into `.data/pgdata/`,
applies all migrations, serves at http://localhost:3000.

### Option B — Supabase / Neon / external Postgres

```powershell
cp .env.example .env.local
# Set DATABASE_URL to your Supabase connection string and AUTH_SECRET to a strong secret.
# Optionally set VIDEO_PROVIDER=bunny + BUNNY_STREAM_* for production-grade hosting.
npm install
npm run db:push       # syncs the Drizzle schema
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

### Demo accounts (password = `Password123`)

| Role | Email |
|---|---|
| Teacher (admin) | `admin@portal.dev` |
| Student (acoustic guitar, intermediate) | `alex@portal.dev` |
| Student (piano, advanced) | `riya@portal.dev` |

Open http://localhost:3000.

## Database schema (high level)

```
user            (id, email, name, role[ADMIN|STUDENT],
                 primary_instrument, skill_level, points, …)
account / session / verificationToken                 # Auth.js tables

challenge       (id, title, description, deadline, status, points,
                 instrument_focus, skill_level_target, …)

performance     (id, challenge_id, student_id,
                 instrument, skill_level,
                 video_provider[LOCAL|BUNNY|VIMEO|EMBED],
                 video_url, video_external_id, video_duration_seconds,
                 thumbnail_url, status[PENDING|PUBLISHED|REJECTED],
                 is_verified, is_best_performer, likes_count, …)

feedback        (id, performance_id, teacher_id, note,
                 timestamp_sec,            -- pin to a moment in the video
                 rhythm_score, technique_score, musicality_score,
                 is_private, …)

top_performer   (id, performance_id, challenge_id, selected_by_id,
                 reason, period[CHALLENGE|WEEK|MONTH|ALLTIME], selected_at)

performance_like (performance_id, user_id, created_at)
```

Inferred TypeScript types are exported from `src/db/schema.ts` — use them
everywhere instead of redefining shapes.

## Routes

### Public
- `/` — landing
- `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`
- `/install` (public): add the app to an iPhone or Android home screen. Share this link to invite students.

### Student app (any signed-in role)
A dark, phone-first app shell (`src/app/(app)/(student)`) with an emoji tab
bar and a floating ＋ button that opens the "Upload Your Shred" sheet. Every
upload is submitted for teacher approval before anyone else can see it.
- `/feed` — streak banner plus approved videos mixed with a teacher
  challenge, an achievement, the daily "Guess This Song" quiz and Student of
  the Week; ❤️ 👏 🔥 reactions and share
- `/shorts` — full-height approved videos with category chips
- `/challenges` — active challenges with your status, the 7-day practice
  tracker and completed challenges; `/challenges/[id]` for details
- `/learn` — homework (log practice, submit a take), songs, lesson videos
  and quizzes
- `/profile` — level, XP, stats, collectible badges, achievements and a
  share button (no contact details are ever shown)

XP, levels, streaks and badges are derived in `src/lib/gamification.ts` from
real activity (`xp_event`, `performance_reaction`, approved performances).

### Teacher (admin) only
- `/admin` — studio dashboard
- `/admin/challenges/new` — create challenge with instrument focus + skill target
- `/admin/evaluate` — evaluation studio with per-card actions
- `/admin/health` — Test Agent with one-click diagnostics, full-suite dispatch,
  persisted case results and failure notices

### API
- `POST /api/upload` — auth required, image/video, 25 MB cap, raw storage
- `POST /api/upload/video` — auth required, video only, 200 MB cap, routes
  through `IVideoProvider`. Returns
  `{ provider, externalId, playbackUrl, thumbnailUrl, durationSeconds, contentType, size }`.

Route protection is enforced **twice** — `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 edge
proxy) for redirects, plus `requireAdmin()` / server-component checks for
defence in depth.

---

## Video provider — how to swap

`src/lib/video.ts` ships with three implementations selected by `VIDEO_PROVIDER`:

```env
# .env.local
VIDEO_PROVIDER=bunny
BUNNY_STREAM_LIBRARY_ID=12345
BUNNY_STREAM_API_KEY=...
BUNNY_STREAM_CDN_HOSTNAME=vz-abcdef-123.b-cdn.net
```

```env
VIDEO_PROVIDER=vimeo
VIMEO_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
```

```env
VIDEO_PROVIDER=local        # default — writes to public/uploads/videos/
```

Add a new provider by implementing `IVideoProvider` and adding a `case` in
the factory. **No call-site changes** are required: every `<VideoPlayer>` and
gallery card already understands the four `VideoProvider` enum values.

---

## Storage

`src/lib/storage.ts` exposes `IStorageProvider`. The default
`LocalStorageProvider` writes to `public/uploads/<scope>/<uuid>.<ext>`. Swap
to S3/R2/Supabase Storage by implementing the interface and selecting via
`STORAGE_PROVIDER`.

The local video provider delegates to this storage provider, so configuring
S3 also moves your dev video uploads to S3.

---

## Deploying

The app is **platform-agnostic** — there's no vendor-specific config file
in the repo. Anywhere you can run a Next.js 16 app and reach a Postgres
URL works: Vercel, Render, Fly, Cloudflare Pages, AWS Amplify, a $5 VPS,
your laptop.

On any serverless runtime (Vercel, AWS Lambda, Netlify Functions, etc.)
the Lambda's filesystem **disappears on every cold start**, so writing
video bytes to `public/uploads/` would silently lose them. The app
auto-detects this via `VERCEL=1` / `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME` /
`NETLIFY=true` / `EPHEMERAL_FS=true` and disables the FILE upload tab
*unless* a remote video provider is configured. As soon as you point
`VIDEO_PROVIDER` at `cloudinary`, `bunny`, or `vimeo`, bytes stream
straight from the function to the provider's durable storage and the
FILE tab comes back automatically.

### Vercel (recommended for Next.js)

1. Create a free Postgres at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) — sign in
   with GitHub, pick the EU/US region nearest your users, copy the
   **Pooled connection** string from the project dashboard.
2. [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → **Add New Project** → import this
   repo. Framework auto-detected as Next.js.
3. Before clicking Deploy, paste the env-var block (see `.env.example`)
   into **Environment Variables**. Minimum required for production:

   | Key | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `DATABASE_URL` | the Neon pooled connection string from step 1 |
   | `AUTH_SECRET` | `npx auth secret` or `openssl rand -base64 32` |
   | `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` | `true` |
   | `VIDEO_PROVIDER` | `cloudinary` *(or `bunny` / `vimeo`)* |
   | `CLOUDINARY_URL` | `cloudinary://<key>:<secret>@<cloud_name>` |
   | `CLOUDINARY_FOLDER` | `shred-sound-music/performances` *(optional)* |

4. Deploy. The instrumentation hook applies the idempotent schema on
   cold start so the DB lands at spec automatically. For demo seeding,
   hit `https://<vercel-domain>/api/admin/dbinit?secret=<AUTH_SECRET>`
   once — it inserts the teacher + two student accounts and three
   starter challenges.
5. Custom domain: **Vercel → Project → Settings → Domains** → add
   `your.domain.com`. Vercel shows the CNAME target — add a matching
   record in your DNS provider (Cloudflare, GoDaddy, etc.):

   ```
   Type:  CNAME
   Host:  whatever-subdomain        (use `@` for the apex)
   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   ```

   SSL is issued automatically a few minutes later. If you front the
   site with Cloudflare DNS, set the proxy status to **DNS only** (grey
   cloud) so Vercel can complete its certificate challenge.

6. Keep the Vercel function region next to the Neon region you picked in
   step 1. `vercel.json` pins `"regions": ["sin1"]` to match a Neon
   project in `ap-southeast-1`; change it (`"fra1"` for Frankfurt,
   `"bom1"` for Mumbai, `"iad1"` for US East) if your database lives
   elsewhere. Every query crosses the gap, and the Test Agent's
   "Server and database placement" check fails when they differ.

### Cloudinary credentials — two equivalent formats

| Format | When to use |
|---|---|
| `CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://<key>:<secret>@<cloud_name>` | Copy-paste from the Cloudinary dashboard. Recommended. |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` + `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` + `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | When the platform's secrets manager prefers discrete keys. |

Either works. If both are set, the discrete trio wins per-field.

### Alternative video providers

**Bunny.net Stream** — paid but very cheap, native HLS:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `VIDEO_PROVIDER` | `bunny` |
| `BUNNY_STREAM_LIBRARY_ID` | from the Stream dashboard |
| `BUNNY_STREAM_API_KEY` | from the Stream dashboard |
| `BUNNY_STREAM_CDN_HOSTNAME` | e.g. `vz-abcdef-123.b-cdn.net` |

**Vimeo** — drop-in private/unlisted hosting:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `VIDEO_PROVIDER` | `vimeo` |
| `VIMEO_ACCESS_TOKEN` | an OAuth token with `upload` scope |

### What NOT to set in production

- ❌ `ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS` — dev-only escape hatch for corporate proxies.
  The instrumentation hook refuses to apply it when `NODE_ENV=production`
  but don't add the noise.
- ❌ `DATABASE_URL=memory:` — that's the in-memory PGlite for unit tests
  only; everything resets on every cold start.

---

## Sanity scripts

Two PowerShell scripts in `scripts/` run end-to-end against the dev server:

```powershell
# Read sweep — every route returns the expected status for each role
powershell -File scripts\sanity.ps1 -Email admin@portal.dev -Password Password123 -Role ADMIN
powershell -File scripts\sanity.ps1 -Email alex@portal.dev  -Password Password123 -Role STUDENT

# Write sweep — image + video upload, role-gated UI, music-domain rendering
powershell -File scripts\sanity-write.ps1
```

## End-to-end tests (Playwright)

A full Playwright suite under `tests/e2e/` exercises the UI and backend
across **two projects**: a 1440×900 Desktop Chromium and an iPhone 12
Mobile Safari run. Default `BASE_URL` is `http://localhost:3000` and
Playwright will boot `npm run dev` for you (`reuseExistingServer: true`),
so a fresh clone can run the suite with one command.

```powershell
# Run the full suite (boots the dev server if needed)
npm test

# Run only the desktop Chromium project
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Run only the iPhone 12 mobile-safari project
npx playwright test --project=mobile-safari

# Point the suite at a different deployment (skips the auto-server)
$env:BASE_URL = "https://shred-sound-music.example.com"
npm test
```

The suite covers:

- **Branding & theme** — title is `Shred Sound Music — Performance & Challenge
  Portal`, the new wordmark + Instagram handle (`@shred_sound_music`) appear
  in nav and footer, and **no stale `D Clef Music` / `d-clef-music` /
  `d_clef_music` / `Encore` strings remain** on `/`, `/sign-in` or `/sign-up`.
- **Light theme & banded layout** — body background lightness > 85 and
  foreground < 40 (catches a missing-stylesheet regression), `--primary`
  resolves to a real colour token, and the landing page renders three
  banded sections (cream + ink + white) with the expected headings.
- **Responsive viewports** — at **mobile** (375×812), **tablet** (768×1024),
  **laptop** (1280×800) and **desktop** (1440×900) the page stays within
  its horizontal scrollWidth and the hero CTA is in-bounds; the hero is
  single-column on mobile and 2-column at ≥ 1024 px.
- **Public surfaces** — sign-in / sign-up forms, anon redirects from
  `/admin` and `/feed` to `/sign-in`.
- **Auth & feed** — student sign-in lands on `/challenges` with seeded
  data, feed shows the Best Performer spotlight, **liking a performance
  increases the like count**, and the uploader steers students to the
  embed flow when the deployment can't accept direct uploads.
- **Navigation** — clicking a challenge card on `/challenges` lands on the
  detail page with all four banded sections; navbar wordmark routes back
  to `/`; teacher navbar exposes the **Studio** link, students do not.
- **Teacher / admin** — dashboard stats render, `/admin/evaluate` exposes
  Verify / Crown Best / Add feedback, the date-time picker has a visible
  trigger and closes immediately on date selection, the create-challenge
  form actually creates a challenge and redirects, and an invalid
  submission shows an inline error rather than a 500 page.
- **API health** — `/api/auth/session` returns JSON for anon,
  `/api/admin/dbinit` refuses requests without a valid secret,
  `/api/upload/video` refuses anonymous uploads, `/api/upload/capabilities`
  reports a coherent posture (`uploadsEnabled` boolean + storageProvider
  + videoProvider).
- **Capability matrix** — `getUploadCapabilities()` returns
  `uploadsEnabled=false` only when the runtime is ephemeral (auto-detected
  via `VERCEL=1` / `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME` / `NETLIFY=true` /
  `EPHEMERAL_FS=true`) AND the video provider is `local`; any remote
  video provider (`cloudinary` / `bunny` / `vimeo`) flips the FILE tab
  back on automatically. Seven dedicated specs cover every cell of that
  matrix.

Open the HTML report after a run with `npm run test:report`.

### Admin Test Agent

Teachers can open `/admin/health` and run production-safe smoke diagnostics.
The **Run all test cases** button dispatches the complete Playwright suite to
GitHub Actions; **Retest failures** reruns only failed titles.

Configure the deployed app with `TEST_RUN_INGEST_SECRET`,
`GITHUB_DISPATCH_ENABLED=true`, `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_REPO`, and
`TEST_BASE_URL`. Add the same `TEST_RUN_INGEST_SECRET` as a GitHub Actions
repository secret. Student-facing notices contain only safe service messages;
technical traces remain restricted to teachers.

## What's done vs. what's next

### Done
- Music-first schema (instruments, skill levels, video metadata, multi-axis
  feedback, top_performers audit table)
- `IVideoProvider` with Local / Bunny.net / Vimeo / Cloudinary
- `/api/upload/video` with auth, MIME, and size guards
- Performance uploader (file or embed) tagging instrument + skill
- Filterable feed + per-challenge gallery
- Best Performer spotlight on feed and challenge detail
- Teacher evaluation studio with timestamped feedback (captures playhead)
  and 0–10 scoring on rhythm / technique / musicality
- Verified badge + Best Performer crown with audit trail in `top_performer`
- **Light banded theme** sized for mobile, tablet and laptop
- **Cross-viewport Playwright suite** — Desktop Chromium + iPhone 12 Mobile
  Safari, with brand-cleanup, banded-layout, responsive-viewport,
  navigation, and capability tests

### Next
- **Native mobile app.** The current target is a polished mobile-web
  experience; a React Native (Expo) or Capacitor wrapper can sit on top of
  the same Next.js API routes (`/api/upload/video`, `/api/auth/*`,
  `/api/upload/capabilities`).
- TikTok-style vertical-scroll feed mode (current is a grid spotlight)
- Likes endpoint + leaderboard view (table + `points` column already exist)
- Email + Google OAuth wiring (env vars are already there)
- HLS playback through `hls.js` for non-Safari browsers (Cloudinary already
  emits `m3u8` URLs as well as MP4 — wiring is one component swap)

---

## Known notes

- **PGlite is single-process.** If you mutate the DB from a `tsx` script
  while the dev server is running, the server holds stale in-memory state
  until restart. Use `npm run db:seed` only when the dev server is stopped,
  or prefer Supabase/Neon for parallel-process workflows.
- **`Unhandled Rejection: TypeError: ... Received an instance of URL`**
  during `POST /api/auth/callback/credentials` is upstream noise from
  `next-auth@beta` running under Turbopack. The credentials callback still
  returns 302 and sets the session cookie. Functional sanity is green.
